# Phishing_Website_Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a web application for detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. Phishing websites are malicious websites that attempt to deceive users into providing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal information.

The web application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a URL, and the system will analyze it to determine if it's a phishing website or not. The application utilizes machine learning models trained on various features extracted from website URLs and content to make predictions.

## Features
- Input field for users to enter a URL for analysis.
- Phishing detection algorithm based on machine learning models.
- Feedback mechanism for users to report false positives or negatives.
- Responsive design for usability across different devices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2.  https://github.com/sirri173/phishing_website_detection.git
  
## Usage
1. Run the web application:
2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
3. Enter a URL in the provided input field and submit it for analysis.
4. The application will display whether the website is classified as phishing or not.
